# Machine Learning for analysis of hyperspectral images: Code
Before consider taking a look at the code, first, I recommend to read the [final report](https://github.com/davidcuberovalentin/TFG/blob/main/TFG_Final_Report_David_Cubero_Valentin.pdf) of this thesis.

In order to install the requirements of the project use: ``pip3 install requirements.txt``

In order to download the hyperspectral data use this [link](https://mega.nz/folder/wclElBAJ#MUlMT_Fq4KUE8I0SKU_H5A) and place the data into the same directory as the project.

The scripts that you are able to run are:

*   **detection4.py**: to run all quantitative and qualitative experiments (detection and K-Means + detection).
*   **KMeans.py**: to run K-Means and see its results.

In order to do that, use ``python3 name_of_the_file.py``.
